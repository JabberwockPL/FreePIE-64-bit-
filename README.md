FreePIE 64-bit version
======================

This is the latest [FreePIE](http://andersmalmgren.github.io/FreePIE/) software developed by Anders Malmgren, modified so that it works with 64-bit plugins. Note that it most likely will break compatibility with older plugins (the internal plugins should work). Expect some bugs, quirks or irregularities.

If something does NOT work, or works incorrectly, please DO NOT bother the author of the original software â€“ he is not able to actively support it anyway.
