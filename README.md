FreePIE 64-bit version
======================

This is a version of [FreePIE](http://andersmalmgren.github.io/FreePIE/) software developed by Anders Malmgren, modified so that it works with 64-bit plugins. Note that it most likely will break compatibility with older external plugins (the internal plugins should work). Expect some bugs, quirks or irregularities.

Beside the 64-bit compatibility, the only major change is that the mouse plugin (somewhat) supports absolute position of the cursor, both as input and as output. It works only in some games, as for most (especially 3D first person ones) the mouse movements ignore the absolute position.

If something does NOT work, or works incorrectly, please DO NOT bother the author of the original software â€“ he is not able to actively support it anyway.
